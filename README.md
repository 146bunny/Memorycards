Description:
The Memory Cards Game is a fun and interactive web-based game that tests your memory and concentration skills. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easily accessible through any modern web browser.

How to Play:

Objective: The goal of the game is to match all the pairs of cards within the shortest number of flips and less time.

Card Grid: At the beginning of each game, a grid of face-down cards is displayed, with the card backs facing up.

Gameplay: Click on any card to reveal its hidden face. Then, click on another card to find its matching pair.

Matching Pairs: If the two revealed cards have the same symbol, they will remain face-up and be considered a successful match.

Non-Matching Pairs: If the two cards do not match, they will be turned face-down again, and you can try to find another matching pair.

Winning Condition: The game ends when all the pairs are successfully matched. The final score is determined based on the number of moves you made.
